      <h1>Getting Started</h1>

        Lineup styles are applied to the default elements such as input, select box and other common elements. The other elements such as buttons and status elements consist of several classes and guidelines that are explained in the lineup portal.

      <h3>Lineup Functional Introduction</h3>
      <p>Theming in Lineup is accomplished by Sass variables, Sass maps, and custom CSS. There is no dedicated theme stylesheet; instead, you will be able to support the built-in theme to combine gradients, shadows, and so on.</p>

      <h4>Sass</h4>
      <p>Utilize our source Sass files related to variables, maps, mixins, and so on. In our build, we have increased the Sass rounding precision to 6 (by default it is 5) to avoid issues with browser rounding.</p>
      <h4>File structure</h4>
      <p>Whenever possible, avoid modifying Lineup core files. For Sass, it means creating your own stylesheet only for required panels colors or any other addon features. Assuming you are using a package manager like npm, the file structure looks like this:</p>

      <p>
        your-project/<br>
├── scss<br>
│   └── custom.scss<br>
└── node_modules/<br>
    └── @Rocketui/Rocketui<br>
        ├── js<br>
        └── scss<br>
